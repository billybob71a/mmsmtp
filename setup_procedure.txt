#Setting up mmsmtp file
#Not sure how this got set succesfully at the end because I used a whole bunch of references
https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/msmtp
and this
https://hostpresto.com/community/tutorials/how-to-send-email-from-the-command-line-with-msmtp-and-mutt/
Mostly because I got the idea from the following forum that I use mmsmtp instead of ssmtp
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=244147

sudo apt-get install msmtp msmtp-mta

create a /var/log/msmtp.log

sudo touch /var/log/msmtp.log
chmod ugo+r /var/log/msmtp.log
chmod ugo+w /var/log/msmtp.log

sudo vi /etc/msmtprc

account default
auth on
tls on
tls_starttls on
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
from <the sender of the email address
user <email address that authenicates on the google account>
password <the password>

tested with :
sudo echo "Subject: subject test"  | msmtp <phonenumber>@pcs.rogers.com

It works.

Or 

You could do:

echo "mail test1" | mail -s "test1" <phonenumber>@pcs.rogers.com
